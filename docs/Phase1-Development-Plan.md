# Phase 1 Development Plan: MVP "Real-Time Drawing" (3 weeks)

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1 Overview**
**Goal**: Create a working real-time drawing application where two people can create/join private rooms and draw together

---

## **Week 1: Foundation & WebSocket Setup**
**Goal**: Get real-time communication working first

### **Days 1-2: Flask-SocketIO Setup**
- [ ] Set up Flask-SocketIO project structure
- [ ] Create basic Flask app with Socket.io integration
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection between server and client
- [ ] Handle basic connect/disconnect events
- [ ] Verify real-time messaging works

### **Days 3-4: Project Setup & Basic Drawing**
- [ ] Create proper Flask project structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment and dependencies
- [ ] Create HTML template with Canvas element
- [ ] Implement mouse event handlers (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup)
- [ ] Basic drawing with lines and stroke styles

### **Days 5-7: Drawing Improvements**
- [ ] Add color picker and brush size controls
- [ ] Implement clear canvas button
- [ ] Add touch support for mobile devices
- [ ] Smooth line drawing (preventing jagged lines)
- [ ] Basic drawing tools (pen, eraser)
- [ ] Save canvas state functionality

**Deliverable**: Working single-player drawing app with WebSocket foundation

---

## **Week 2: Real-Time Drawing Synchronization**
**Goal**: Two browser windows can see each other's drawing in real-time

### **Days 8-9: Drawing Synchronization**
- [ ] Send drawing events via WebSocket
- [ ] Receive and replay drawing events on other clients
- [ ] Handle stroke start, continue, and end events
- [ ] Optimize data transmission (only send deltas)
- [ ] Test real-time drawing between two browser windows

### **Days 10-11: Multi-User Canvas**
- [ ] Support multiple connected users simultaneously
- [ ] Assign different colors per user automatically
- [ ] Handle canvas clearing for all users
- [ ] Manage multiple simultaneous strokes
- [ ] Handle drawing conflicts and overlaps

### **Days 12-14: Stability & Error Handling**
- [ ] Basic error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Handle user disconnections gracefully
- [ ] Prevent drawing data loss during brief disconnections
- [ ] Add connection status indicators
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Deliverable**: Multiple people can draw together in real-time

---

## **Week 3: Room System & Polish**
**Goal**: Private rooms with shareable codes and complete user experience

### **Days 15-16: Room Creation & Welcome Screen**
- [ ] Generate unique room codes (6 characters)
- [ ] Create welcome screen UI with room creation/join options
- [ ] Implement room creation page/interface
- [ ] Add room code input and validation
- [ ] Basic room state management

### **Days 17-18: Room Features**
- [ ] Display player list in each room
- [ ] Implement room-specific drawing canvases
- [ ] Add leave room functionality
- [ ] Room cleanup when empty
- [ ] Handle room not found errors

### **Days 19-21: Polish & Testing**
- [ ] Improve welcome screen design and user flow
- [ ] Add connection status indicators
- [ ] Implement basic responsive design
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Deliverable**: Complete MVP with private rooms and polished user experience

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1 Success Criteria**
At the end of Phase 1, the application must:
- [ ] Two people can create/join a private room via welcome screen
- [ ] Drawing appears on both screens in < 200ms
- [ ] Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- [ ] Handles basic connection issues gracefully
- [ ] Clean, intuitive user interface
- [ ] Stable performance with multiple users

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technical Decisions**
- **Flask-SocketIO**: Real-time WebSocket communication
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Cross-platform drawing support
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Simple, no framework complexity
- **Room-based architecture**: Scalable multi-user support
- **6-character room codes**: Easy to share, hard to guess

---

## ðŸ“Š **Weekly Milestones**
- **Week 1 End**: Working drawing app with WebSocket foundation
- **Week 2 End**: Real-time multi-user drawing
- **Week 3 End**: Complete MVP with rooms and polish

**Ready to begin development!** ðŸš€
